### Getting started
If you have not got our [Back-End](https://github.com/felizj17/snackalog_back_end) up and running, do that first.

After you started the backend and are retrieving data from the api's you are ready to get started with the front end.

First clone this repo onto your machine

In the terminal, navigate to that folder and run the following command `npm install`

You can then run `npm start`, snack-a-log should then be running on your localhost.

you should land on the home page
